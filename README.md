# GifTastic

This is an app designed to locate Gifs related to the movie titles you add to the page.

When the user first loads the application, they're presented with a mostly blank page consisting only of premade buttons with movie title labels and an input form. Clicking these buttons will load information from two different API's.

The first API is OMDB and it displays the movie poster along with information about the movie title you clicked on. The second API is from Giphy and will load ten Gifs related to the movie title below the poster/movie info.
The user has an option to load ten more Gifs at a time with a button at the bottom of the page.

All of the Gifs load in a paused state, but clicking them turns on it's animation. Clicking again will re-pause them. You can also add gifs to a favorite page by clicking the favorite button under each image. Accessing them is just a click away near the top of the page.

Users can expand their search by adding their own favorite movies to the page. Enter a movie title in the text box and click the add movie button. A new button with your movie will now be displayed. No blank entries or duplicates will load into the buttons.

The page is completely responsive so it can be enjoyed from even the smallest screen. I hope you enjoy my application and happy searching!
